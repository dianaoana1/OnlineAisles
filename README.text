Part 1 : This program was designed to emmulate a grocery store websitesuch as IGA or Metro. Some of the feature is has are user login/ account editing pages, a main page, products and aisles page, a checkout,a page to check the orders placed, and much more. 
A combination of HTML5 (for the website main frame) and CSS (for the webpage styling) we used. This webpage is static at the moment and needs additional JavaScript code to make it more dynamic.
The page will be hosted locally by a member of the team on his computer.

Part 2 : In this 2nd part of the project, the website becomes dynamic instead of static. All the relevant buttons of every pages were
implemented using either javascript or html. All the responsiveness was fixed using css. The page we still be hosted locally on a member's computer.

Part 3: In this 3rd part of the project we will take the last 2 parts to create a website that is functional on the backend as well as the
fronted some features to have admin rights are implemented and allow the admin to affect the values of the users the orders and the products.
These values will interact with the pages and let the user know the current values at all time.
